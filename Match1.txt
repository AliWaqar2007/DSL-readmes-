This HTML file creates a simple counter application with increment, decrement, and reset functionalities.

HTML Structure:

The document includes Bootstrap for styling and is structured with a container holding a card.
The card displays the counter value and three buttons: Increment, Reset, and Decrement.

CSS:

Basic styling is included to enhance the appearance of the counter and buttons using Bootstrap classes.

JavaScript:

The counter variable holds the current count.
The increment function increases the counter by one and updates the displayed value.
The decrement function decreases the counter by one (if greater than zero) and updates the displayed value.
The reset function sets the counter back to zero.
The decrement button is disabled if the counter is zero to prevent negative values.
