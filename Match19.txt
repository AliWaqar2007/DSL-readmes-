This HTML document creates beautiful cards with a fade-in effect when they come into view:

Card Structure: Each card consists of an image, a title, a description, and a "Read More" button.

Card Styling: Cards have a white background, border-radius, and a box-shadow to create a neat appearance.

Fade-in Effect: Cards have an initial opacity of 0 and a translateY transform to move them slightly downwards. When a card enters the viewport, it fades in and moves up.
Here's a breakdown of the JavaScript functionality:

The DOMContentLoaded event listener ensures that the JavaScript code runs after the HTML content has been loaded.
It selects all the elements with the class card.
An IntersectionObserver is created to monitor the visibility of these elements.
When a card enters the viewport (isIntersecting becomes true), the show class is added to it, causing it to fade in and move up.
When a card leaves the viewport (isIntersecting becomes false), the show class is removed, making it disappear again.
This implementation provides a smooth and visually appealing user experience by revealing the cards with a subtle animation as the user scrolls down the page.
