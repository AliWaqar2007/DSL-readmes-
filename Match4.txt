User Age HTML File

Explanation:
This HTML file creates a simple application that checks if the user's age qualifies them to vote (i.e., if they are 18 years or older).

HTML Structure:
The document includes a container that holds a form for entering the user's age and a button to submit the form.
A paragraph element displays the result based on the age entered.

CSS:
Styles are included to enhance the appearance of the container, form elements, and background.
The container is centered on the page with a semi-transparent white background.
The button changes color on hover for a better user experience.

JavaScript:
The ageEligibility function checks the age entered in the input field.
If the age is less than 18, it displays a message indicating the user is not eligible to vote.
If the age is 18 or older, it displays a congratulatory message indicating the user is eligible to vote.
