This HTML document showcases an accordion component implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Accordion Structure: Each accordion item consists of a button as the header and a panel containing the content.

CSS Styling: Defines the styles for the accordion, including its appearance, hover effects, and transitions.

JavaScript Functionality:
Handles the accordion behavior by toggling the active class and adjusting the panel's height.
Utilizes max-height to animate the expansion and collapse of the panels.
The JavaScript code loops through each accordion item and adds a click event listener to toggle its active state. When an accordion item is clicked:

It expands the associated panel by setting its max-height to the scroll height of the panel content.
Collapses any previously expanded panels.
Toggles the active class to visually indicate the active state of the clicked accordion item.
This implementation ensures that only one panel can be expanded at a time and provides a smooth transition effect when opening and closing the panels.
