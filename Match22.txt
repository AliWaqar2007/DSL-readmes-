This HTML document creates a simple weather app that fetches the current weather based on the user's geolocation:

HTML Structure: The structure includes a container (div.container) containing a heading (h2), a button to fetch weather data (button), and paragraphs to display temperature and weather description (p#temperature and p#description).

Styling: CSS styles the container, headings, button, and paragraphs to give the app a visually appealing look.

JavaScript Functionality:

The weather function is triggered when the "Get Weather" button is clicked.
It first checks if geolocation is supported by the browser.
If supported, it retrieves the user's current position using navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition.
Then, it constructs the API URL using the user's latitude and longitude and makes a fetch request to the OpenWeatherMap API.
Upon receiving the response, it converts the temperature from Kelvin to Celsius and extracts the weather description.
Finally, it updates the HTML elements with the temperature and weather description.
If any error occurs during the process, it alerts the user.
This weather app provides a simple way to get the current weather based on the user's location.
