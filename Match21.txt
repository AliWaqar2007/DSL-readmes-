This HTML document creates a simple carousel:

Carousel Structure: The carousel consists of a container (div.carousel) with a set of slides (div.slides) containing images.

Styling: The CSS provides styles for the carousel container, slides, and control buttons (#Previous, #Next, #play).

JavaScript Functionality:
The JavaScript code handles the functionality of the carousel.
It defines functions to show the previous and next slides (prevSlide, nextSlide), as well as to autoplay the slides (autoPlay).
Event listeners are added to the previous, next, and play/pause buttons to trigger the corresponding functions when clicked.
The showSlide function is responsible for displaying a specific slide and hiding the rest.
The autoplay feature changes slides automatically every 2 seconds.
The first slide is shown immediately when the page loads.
This carousel provides basic functionality for cycling through images with autoplay and manual navigation controls.
