Calculator HTML File
Explanation:
This HTML file creates a simple calculator application that performs basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division).

HTML Structure:
The document includes Bootstrap and FontAwesome for styling.
The form contains two input fields for numbers, a dropdown for selecting the operation, a button to perform the calculation, and a paragraph to display the result.

CSS:
Styles are included to enhance the appearance of the form using Bootstrap and custom styles.
The background is a linear gradient, and the form has a semi-transparent white background with rounded corners and a box shadow.
The form also includes an animation for scaling in when the page loads.

JavaScript:
The calculate function retrieves the input values and the selected operation, performs the calculation, and displays the result in the paragraph element.
The function uses a switch statement to determine the operation to perform.
