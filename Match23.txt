This HTML document creates a lightbox gallery, allowing users to view larger versions of images in a modal window when clicked:

HTML Structure: The structure includes a set of images displayed in columns within a row (div.row). Each image is wrapped in a div.column. Additionally, there is a hidden lightbox (div.lightbox) that displays the larger version of the clicked image.

Styling: CSS styles the layout, images, and lightbox to create a visually appealing gallery. The hover-shadow class adds a shadow effect when hovering over the images.

JavaScript Functionality:

The openModal function is triggered when an image is clicked. It sets the display of the lightbox to "block" and updates the source of the lightbox image (img#lightbox-image) to the clicked image's source.
The closeLightbox function sets the display of the lightbox to "none" when the close button (span.close) is clicked.
Additionally, the script includes an event listener that closes the lightbox when clicking outside of the lightbox container.
This lightbox gallery provides a simple and effective way to showcase images in a larger format without leaving the current page.
