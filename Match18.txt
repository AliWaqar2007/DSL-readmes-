This HTML document creates a countdown timer:

Timer Display: The timer is displayed in a div element with the id timer.

Form Input: Users can input the date and time they want to count down to using a datetime-local input field.

Start Button: Clicking the "Start Timer" button triggers the countdown timer.
Here's a breakdown of the JavaScript functionality:

When the "Start Timer" button is clicked, the startCountdown function is called.
This function prevents the default form submission behavior.
It retrieves the input date and time from the datetime-local input field and converts it into a JavaScript Date object.
Inside the update function, which is called repeatedly at intervals of 1 second using setInterval, the current time is compared to the target countdown time.
The remaining time (in days, hours, minutes, and seconds) is calculated and displayed in the timerDiv.
If the countdown is over (the remaining time is less than or equal to 0), the interval is cleared, and the message "Time is up" is displayed in the timerDiv.
This implementation provides a simple countdown timer that dynamically updates every second until the specified date and time is reached.
