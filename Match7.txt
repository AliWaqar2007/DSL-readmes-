Currency Converter HTML File

Explanation:
This HTML file creates a simple currency converter application that converts an amount from one currency to another using predefined conversion rates.

HTML Structure:

The document includes Bootstrap for styling.
The form includes an input field for the amount, dropdown menus for selecting the "from" and "to" currencies, and a button to perform the conversion.
A paragraph element is used to display the converted amount.

CSS:
Styles are included to enhance the appearance of the form, input fields, button, and the converted amount display.
The form is centered on the page with a white background, rounded corners, and a box shadow for a clean and modern look.

JavaScript:
The conversionRates object stores the predefined conversion rates between various currencies.
The convert function retrieves the input values, calculates the converted amount using the conversion rate from the conversionRates object, and displays the result in the paragraph element.
